# HTTP Authentication

In this benchmark goal you're going to build an Express HTTP server that allows users to signup, login and logout of your application.

Your HTTP routes will be able to render different information depending on whether the request is from an unknown visitor or a logged in user.

There are a ton of specs you need to build so make sure you break each problem down into smaller steps you can take sequentially.

## Skills

- Can build a HTTP server with Node and Express
- Can track individual users with HTTP cookies
- Can make HTTP POST requests to a server with a form
- Can store data in an HTTP cookie using Node and Express
- Can implement a SQL schema by looking at the specs
- Can use `pg-promise` to communicate to a postgresql server

## Specs

- build this app in a new empty GitHub repository
- use node
- ensure all your npm dependencies are listed in your `package.json`
- use postgresql
- design a database schema to store users
- commit your schema in `schema.sql`
- use the `express` node package
- use the `body-parser` node package
- use the `cookie-session` node package
- use the `pg-promise` node package
- implement the following user stories:
  - when you are not logged in
    - and you visit `/` (the home page) you see:
      - "Hello Stranger"
      - a link to `/signup`
      - a link to `/login`
    - and you visit `/signup`
      - you see:
        - a form with:
          - email
          - password
          - password confirmation
          - "Signup" button
      - and you submit the signup form
        - with no values
          - you should see the signup page again but with the error "please provide
          an email and a password to sign up"
        - with a value in the password field that
          does not match the value in the password confirmation field
          - you should see the signup page again but with the error "passwords do
          not match"
        - with a valid email, and matching passwords
          - a new user should be inserted into the database
          - your session cookie should be updated with the new user id
          - you should be logged in and redirected to the homepage
    - and you visit `/login` you see:
      - a form with:
        - email
        - password
    - and you submit the login form
      - with no values
        - you should see the login page again with the error "please provide an
        email and a password to login"
      - with a correct email but an incorrect password
        - you should see the login page again with the error "incorrect email
        or password"
      - with an incorrect email and any password
        - you should see the login page again with the error "incorrect email
        or password"
      - with a matching email and password
        - you should be logged in and redirect to the home page
    - and you visit `/logout`
      - you are redirected to the home page
  - when you are logged in
    - and you visit `/` (the home page) you see:
      - "Welcome back [email address]"
      - a link to `/logout`
    - and you visit `/login`
      - you are redirected to the homepage
    - and you visit `/signup`
      - you are redirected to the homepage
    - and you visit `/logout`
      - you are logged out and then redirected to the home page

### Stretch

- Write tests for your express routes using `chai-http`
- Encrypt passwords using `bcrypt`

## Testing

If all of the above features are correctly implemented you should be able to

1. signup and be logged in
1. logout
1. login again as that same user
1. logout
1. signup as a different user
1. logout
1. etc…

Also try:

- Using a Chrome incognito window.
- Inspecting and deleting cookies in the Chrome Developer Tools application tab
